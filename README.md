:heavy_check_mark: Backend was made using springboot and java.

## :hammer: Installation / Run

- First of all setup your MySQL database.
- Go to application.properties and add the required credentials to log in to that database, you will need the database's name, username and password.
- If you have IntellijIDEA it will be good to make a new springboot project and then clone of fork this repo because everything else will be done automatically.

## :fountain_pen: Information

The backend has admin/user/bidder/seller security implemented and CORS policy for the links. Also it is using SQL queries to fetch data from the MySQL server and supports POST, GET, PUT, DELETE as methods of giving data to the frontend.
