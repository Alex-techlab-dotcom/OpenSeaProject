:heavy_check_mark: Backend was made using springboot and java.

## :hammer: Installation / Run

- First of all setup your MySQL database.
- Go to application.properties and add the required credentials to log in to that database, you will need the database's name, username and password.
- If you have IntellijIDEA it will be good to make a new springboot project and then clone of fork this repo because everything else will be done automatically.
